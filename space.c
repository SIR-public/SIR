<p><b>Flex</b>, <b>grep</b>, <b>gzip</b>, and <b>make</b> are all unix
utilities obtained from the Gnu site.
<!--
Xearth is a program that displays a shaded image of the earth in an X window.

We obtained several sequential, previously-released versions of each of 
these programs.</p>

<p>For these objects, with the exception of a few &quot;smoke&quot; tests, comprehensive
test suites were not available.  To construct test cases representative of
those that might be created in practice for these programs, we used the
documentation on the programs, and the parameters and special effects we
determined to be associated with each program, as informal specifications.
We used these informal specifications, together with the category partition
method and an implementation of the TSL tool, to construct a suite of test
cases that exercise each parameter, special effect, and erroneous condition
affecting program behavior. We then augmented those test suites with
additional test cases to increase code coverage (measured at the statement
level). We created these suites for the base versions of the programs; they
served as regression suites for subsequent versions.</p>

<p>We wished to evaluate the performance of testing techniques with respect
to detection of regression faults, that is, faults created in a program
version as a result of the modifications that produced that version. Such
faults were not available with our object programs; thus, to obtain them,
we followed a procedure similar to one defined and employed in several
previous studies of testing techniques, as follows. First, we recruited
graduate and undergraduate students in computer science with at least
two years of C programming experience. Then, the students thus recruited
were instructed to insert faults that were as realistic as possible based
on their experience, and that involved code deleted from, inserted into,
or modified between the versions. To further direct their efforts, the
fault seeders were given a list of types of faults to consider.</p>

<p>Given ten potential faults seeded in each version of each program, we
activated these faults individually, and executed the test suites for the
programs to determine which faults could be revealed by which test cases.
We excluded any potential faults that were not detected by any test cases:
such faults are meaningless to our measures and have no bearing on results.
We also excluded any faults that were detected by more than 25% of the test
cases; our assumption was that such easily detected faults would be detected
by engineers during their unit testing of modifications.</p>

<p>Use of these subjects, as well as the Siemens subjects described below,
may require localization in order to successfully build.  Some of these
considerations are presented <a href="http://sir.unl.edu/content/configuration-support.php">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="space"></a>Space</h3>

<p>Space consists of 9564 lines of C code (6218 executable), and functions as
an interpreter for an array definition language (ADL).  The program reads
a file that contains several ADL statements, and checks the contents of
the file for adherence to the ADL grammar and to specific consistency rules.
If the ADL file is correct, space outputs an array data file containing a
list of array elements, positions, and excitations; otherwise the program
outputs error messages.</p>

<p>Space has 33 associated versions, each containing a single fault that
had been discovered during the program's development.  Through working with
this program, we discovered five additional faults, and created versions
containing just those faults.  We also discovered that three of the "faulty
versions" originally supplied were actually semantically equivalent to the
base version.</p>

<p>We constructed a test pool for space in two stages.  We obtained an initial
pool of 10,000 test cases from Vokolos and Frankl, they had created this pool
for another study by randomly generating test cases [Vokolos98].
Beginning with this initial pool, we instrumented the program for coverage
and then added additional test cases to the pool until it contained, for
each executable statement or edge (though unlike the Siemens programs, not
for each definition-use pair) in the program or its control flow graph,
at least 30 test cases that exercised that statement or edge.  (We treated
the statements and edges executable only on failure of one of the seventeen
malloc calls found in the program as non-executable.) This process yielded
a test pool of 13,585 test cases.</p>

<p>To obtain sample test suites for space, we used this test pool and sampling
procedures.   We have created several types of suites, some randomly selected,
some coverage adequate.  The Space CONTENTS files describe the types of suites.</p>

<h3><a name="siemens"></a>Siemens</h3>

<p>The &quot;Siemens&quot; programs were assembled by Tom Ostrand and colleagues
at Siemens Corporate Research for a study of the fault detection
capabilities of control-flow and data-flow coverage criteria [Hutchins94],
and were made available to us by Tom Ostrand.  They have since been
partially modified by us for use in further studies.</p>

<p>The Siemens programs perform a variety of tasks: <b>tcas</b> is an aircraft
collision avoidance system, <b>schedule2</b> and <b>schedule</b> are priority schedulers,
<b>totinfo</b> computes statistics given input data, <b>printtokens</b> and <b>printtokens2</b>
are lexical analyzers, and <b>replace</b> performs pattern matching and substitution.</p>

<p>The researchers at Siemens sought to study the fault detecting effectiveness
of coverage criteria.  Therefore, they created faulty versions of the seven
base programs by manually seeding those programs with faults, usually by
modifying a single line of code in the program.  Their goal was to introduce
faults that were as realistic as possible, based on their experience with
real programs.  Ten people performed the fault seeding, working mostly
without knowledge of each other's work.  The result of this effort was
between 7 and 41 versions of each base program, each containing a single fault.</p>

<p>For each base program, the researchers at Siemens created a large test pool
containing possible test cases for the program.  To populate these test pools,
they first created an initial suite of black-box test cases according to good
testing practices, based on the tester's understanding of the program's
functionality and knowledge of special values and boundary points that are
easily observable in the code, using the category partition method and the
Siemens Test Specification Language tool. They then augmented this suite
with manually-created white-box test cases to ensure that each executable
statement, edge, and definition-use pair in the base program or its
control-flow graph was exercised by at least 30 test cases.  To obtain
meaningful results with the seeded versions of the programs, the researchers
retained only faults that were neither too easy nor too hard to detect,
which they defined as being detectable by at most 350 and at least 3 test
cases in the test pool associated with each program.</p>

<p>To obtain sample test suites for these programs, we used the test pools for
the base programs and sampling procedures to create suites.   We have created
several types of suites, some randomly selected, some coverage adequate.
The Siemens CONTENTS files describe the types of suites.</p>
